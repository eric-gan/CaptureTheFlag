## To play:

1. Download the associated files.

2. Run `Main.java` under `CaptureTheFlag/Core/`

## Instructions:

Worlds are pseudorandomly generated. The same seed corresponds with the same world. You can also save the game anytime on close and load up the game from the start menu by pressing `L`.

Player 1 moves via `WASD` and player 2 moves using `IJKL`. The goal of the game is to get the flag (denoted in pink) to your associated base which is denoted by a tile of the same color as your player.

The red tiles are monsters. Touch any of them and you'll lose a life and be sent all the way back to base.

Once you have the flag, if you touch a monster, or get tagged by the other person, you will be sent to base and the flag put back where it is.

You win by either capturing the flag or if the opponent loses all their lives.
